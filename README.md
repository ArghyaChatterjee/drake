## Bipedal Walking Robots
### 1st Assignment
Design a dynamic Simulation of the Rimless Wheel to develop phase portraits of the dynamics. Submit plots of the phase portraits as they vary from different slopes. Plot how the limit cycles of these phase portraits vary when contacts occur at different times. Explain how these elements relate to the physical parameters of the rimless wheel.

### Answer:
A rimless wheel acts as a passive dynamic walker.

    The phase portrait for a rimless wheel on a level surface (slope of 0.0 radians) showcases a distinct dynamic pattern, illustrated by the blue lines which represent the trajectory of the wheel's angular velocity (`thetadot`) against its angular position (`theta`). The star marker indicates the initial condition from which the wheel's motion is simulated. Notably, the trajectories converge into a horizontal band, indicating that, irrespective of the starting angular velocity, the system stabilizes to a steady-state motion with minimal fluctuation in `thetadot`. The lack of a slope means there is no gravitational contribution to the wheel's potential energy, leading to a motion primarily governed by the initial kinetic energy and dissipation due to the ground contact. The uniformity of the gray energy contour lines suggests that energy dissipation is consistent across collisions, which is expected in the absence of a slope. This behavior is indicative of the natural tendency of the rimless wheel to reach a constant rolling speed on a flat surface, highlighting the inherent stability of the system under such conditions.

    The phase portrait on a 7.0-radian slope reveals a highly dynamic system, where the blue trajectory depicting angular velocity (`thetadot`) against angular position (`theta`) shows multiple oscillations indicative of rapid accelerations and decelerations. Starting from the initial condition marked by a star, the wheel experiences a significant conversion of gravitational potential into kinetic energy as it descends the slope, followed by energy loss as it climbs, creating a wave-like pattern. The nearly vertical sections of the trajectory suggest the impact points of the wheel's legs with the ground, leading to abrupt changes in motion. The gray contour lines represent constant energy levels, enclosing the trajectory and indicating a potential perpetual motion if external forces were absent. This complex behavior underscores the influence of gravity on the wheel's stability and the challenges it faces in maintaining a predictable path on such steep inclines.
